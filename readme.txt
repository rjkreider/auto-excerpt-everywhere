The plugin automatically displays excerpts instead of full post contents in your blog. Custom excerpts and generated excerpts supported.


== Description ==

Created to help those people who don't like to edit code in template files (or are too lazy to do that).
Just activate the plugin and it will automatically show the_excerpts in your homepage, archives and search results.
It tries to display your custom excerpt text and if it doesn't find it it will show an automatically generated excerpt.
You can also define excerpt length, custom read more link and attach a thumbnail.


== Installation ==


1. Upload the zipped file to yoursite/wp-content/plugins
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


== Upgrade Notice ==

This release supports two new features:
1) you can choose to attach a thumbnail to your post excerpt
2) you can disable the excerpt in your rss feeds

Bug of the blank "read more text" option is now fixed.
